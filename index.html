            The first thing that strikes in our minds when we think about 
            education is gaining knowledge. Education is a tool which provides 
            people with knowledge, skill, technique, information, enables them
            to know their rights and duties toward their family, society as well 
            as the nation. It expands vision and outlook to see the world. 
            It develops the capabilities to fight against injustice, violence, 
            corruption and many other bad elements in the society.
            <br>
            Education gives us knowledge of the world around us. It develops in 
            us a perspective of looking at life. It is the most important element 
            in the evolution of the nation. Without education, one will not explore 
            ew ideas. It means one will not able to develop the world because without 
            ieas there is no creativity and without creativity, there is no
            development of the nation.

                <br>
                Education helps a person to be able to read and write. Most of the 
                information is communicated by writing. A man who has this ability to 
                read is called a literate.
